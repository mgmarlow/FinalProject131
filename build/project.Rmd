# Abstract

# Introduction


# Data Description
The data that I used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is called `automobile` and contains `25` variables, the most important of which is `symboling`, the index of safety that this project will use to classify the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd('C:/Users/Graham/Desktop/FinalProject131/src')
source('prelims.R', local=TRUE)
data <- data.frame(new.data, num.binary)

# Show distribution of symboling, vanilla data
hist(safety.data$symboling,
     xlab = 'Symboling',
     ylab = 'Frequency',
     main = 'Histogram of Symboling')
```

Above is a histogram of `symboling` from the vanilla dataset. As we can see from the distribution of frequencies, most of the observations are either `0` or positive, with only a very few vehicles being classified as completley safe in the negative values. Therefore, to balance the data for my analysis, I will count a `symboling` value of `0` as 'safe'.

Additionally, due to the fact that the random forest method will not work with any blank or `NA` values, I removed all observations that contained such values.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Distribution of symboling after removing blank observations
hist(data$symboling,
     xlab = 'Symboling',
     ylab = 'Frequency',
     main = 'Histogram of Symboling, Partial Data')
```

Here is the new distribution of `symboling` values, in a new dataset with  all observations containing `NA` removed. There is not a whole lot of change happening between the two distributions, so I think that removing the observations that contain blank values is justified.
