# Safety Ratings of Automobiles

## Goal
Discover what variables from automobiles contribute most to safety ratings. Safety ratings are based upon an index called the 'symboling' index that is a range from [-3,3], where `-3` indicates that the auto is safe and `3` indicates that the auto is risky. 

There are a total of `25` variables in the dataset other than the symboling index that might contribute to the risk rating. However, seeing as the `make` of the auto shouldn't have an effect on the risk rating, we shall remove that variable from the dataset. Therefore, our data consists of `1` variable that we wish to analyze (symboling) and `24` variables that may or may not contribute to the symboling rating.
